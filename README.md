# electron-plan-rfc
Roadmap and requests for change for electron-plan and related projects.

# Executive Summary
Electron is getting good enough I'm starting to want multiple small applications to **reuse** in a single electron install.  One could imagine a system in which mutiple applications reuse update, packaging (wrapped NPM), user consent, crash reporting, etc..

I, Chris Tracy aka @yzorg, plan to write the first of these apps, a FOSS tabbed file browser for Win10.  More elaborate parts of the roadmap will be ironed-out as experiments within yzFolder.

For those app authors that want to ride this out with me: I hope, in the next few years, to make it much easier to bring local apps built on web platorm technology to the masses.  

I want this for myself, and I plan to build it for myself.  If I bring a few of you along with me I think this could unlock yet unseen potential for what used to be called the web platorm stack, standing on shoulders of giants and all.  (v8 / nodejs / npm / chromium / electron / typescript / vscode / react / preact / etc)
